# MovieTrailerWebsite
This project creates a Movie Trailer website.
Given a list of favourite movies it generates a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailers.


# Usage
In entertainment_center.py we can define the list of favourtie movies by instantiating the Movie class by giving the title of the movie, the image url and the trailer url.
In ud036_StarterCode, the fresh_tomatoes.py file generates the source code of a webpage
The result is fresh_tomatoes.html that you can load in a browser
